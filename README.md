# Project S.M.I.L.E.
## Smart Management of Integrated Life Entropy
Project S.M.I.L.E. is a personal AI assistant designed to transform life’s daily chaos into seamless order. Built to be witty, sociable, and a little bit nerdy, S.M.I.L.E. combines advanced memory, decision-making, and conversation tools to help manage emails, schedules, and everyday tasks. With a focus on adaptive communication, S.M.I.L.E. can switch between modes like “Focus” for productivity or “Therapist” for support, creating a personalized experience for any need. This open-source project is built to integrate effortlessly, using science and smart architecture to bring a friendly, organized touch to life’s entropy.
